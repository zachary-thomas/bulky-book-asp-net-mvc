https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-aspnet-core-21-course/

The app utilizes user roles, a robust product system, an order management system, Facebook and Google authentication, Twilio SMS, SendGrid email, Stripe payments, and data tables to name a few.

Note that emails don't work on release due to SendGrid requiring a hosted domain name.

To run this for yourself, you'll have to have SQL installed on your computer. The project is already setup to create the database if one does not exist. You will also have to populate the secrets.json file that contains Facebook, Google, Stripe, Twilio, and SendGrid API keys and values.
